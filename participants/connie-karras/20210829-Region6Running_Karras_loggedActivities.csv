2021-01-29,15.12,Walk,"Phone finally died today and I flipped the rat race the bird and went for a lovely urban nature hike. What I wouldn't give to be able to go off the grid and not have to ever use a ""smart"" phone again.  ::sigh::  It was the best gift to not have any gadget with me today beyond my Coros Apex and just enjoy perfect Mother Nature - she is so far and above humans and our selfish ways. Still feeling great and no pain despite the gain. I am blessed."

I'm more mentally tired than physically from trying to not become road pizza by careless drivers who just don't give a fu@#."
2021-02-02,2.1,Walk,"After yesterday's close call where a car veered toward me and speed up, causing me to leap out of the way, I won't go outside anymore until the multi-use trails are cleared from the recent snowstorm so I can safely get away from selfish drivers. Found a lbery large, ocal sportsplex  with a 1/4 mile track and good Wi-Fi, so I'll go there today to get in he last 18 miles of my 20 miler today. It's not utilized much,neither, so now that I've had my first vaccination, of I wear an N-95 and stay the hell away from people, I should be fine going there for until my treadmill is fixed."

Pain is much worse than yesterday but NOTHING I can't nurse back to health in due time. Going to finish the last 7 outside now in the church parking lot and my own local streets where I won't risk being taken out by drugged drivers. Blessed to be alive. ❤️"
