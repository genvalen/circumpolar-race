2021-03-11,12.1,Walk,"New, long-range strategy: 3 mile step-back per day from 20, 3 days in a row, followed by a 9 mile ramp up the following day, 1;1 ratio walk:run, as tolerated, or all power walking. My hope is I'll be able to maintain 100+ mile weeks until end of CRAW this way, injury-free. Time will tell. Tmrw's dance card: 22 mile long run. I am blessed
