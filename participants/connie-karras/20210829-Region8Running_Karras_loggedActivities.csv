2021-03-25,10.12,Walk,"Shocked that I woke up feeling so well and fresh after yesterday's challenging dunes 20 miler on unstable surfaces and unchartered territory, part of which included climbing trees to avoid getting my feet wet, and running back into a strong headwind. I've learned if something is too good to be true, it usually is, so took it VERY easy today and erred on the side of caution with only a leisurely 10 mile walk. Plus, Sunday is my 55th birthday and I want to achieve high mileage safely this weekend. Blessed❤️"
