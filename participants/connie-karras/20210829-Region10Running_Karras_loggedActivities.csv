2021-06-17,5.59,Run,"Planned a 15 mile full heat training gear run along the Chicago Lakeshore this afternoon, but I needed to get home and only had a little bit of time to spare, so I went on the lovely Thorn Creek paved trail. Walked the first 2..5 miles on crushed gravel towpath and ran the last 3 miles. Felt great afterward and stopped my Coros to do calisthenics along the way. Every mile I did: 20 pushups, squats, jumping jacks and squats. Blessed. ❤️"
